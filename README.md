With summer upon us, Python.Py, Dojo wants to bring the best in order to get us all excited for the season. This includes traditions like hotdogs, baseball, and most importantly: beer. We have located and secured a dataset that will help us understand how much and why beer is consumed in Major League stadiums. Questions will include:

Question 1:
Does average household income within the cities for which the stadiums are located have a hand in how much beer is consumed?



There appears to be a positive correlation between the median household income and the price of beer at a MLB game. Based on our analysis, we believe a city's median household income does affect how much, per ounce, a beer costs at a baseball game.

Question #2:
Is the teamsâ€™ record correlated with the amount of beer consumed within the stadium?



Based upon our analysis, there appears to be a negative correlation between a team's record and the average number of drinks consumed at a MLB game. We do not have enough confidence in the R-value to accept our null-hypothesis.

The source of our dataset is based on a few factors:

The US Census

Team Marketing Data Report
